Everyone thinks that his or her code is without bugs, while I think that a bunch of non-trivial amount of code almost definitely contains a bug or two, if not tested properly. And even then, one cannot be sure that no hidden bug lurks somewhere. I was not always like that. Once upon a time I too thought that testing is a waste of time. Why would you test something if you just know it works? Such is the current state in research, good software development practices are rarely followed and it is up to the few of us to try and force the good practices throughout the research organizations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am still learning about what can and should be done. Testing is one of the things I try to enforce with fellow researchers and students, when working on common projects. The other ones are: automation, documentation, and reproducibility. In this post I will describe our testing set-up I established. Since we work mainly with Python, we use popular &lt;a href="https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/"&gt;PyTest&lt;/a&gt; framework for testing and the &lt;a href="https://pytest-cov.readthedocs.io/en/latest/"&gt;pytest-cov&lt;/a&gt;, a PyTest plug-in using &lt;a href="https://coverage.readthedocs.io/en/latest/"&gt;coverage&lt;/a&gt; for measuring the code coverage of Python programs. After the test coverage report generation, the html report is uploaded to a self-hosted &lt;a href="https://min.io/"&gt;Minio&lt;/a&gt; instance for viewing.

&lt;p&gt;Python allowed me to write several pieces of useful software using drastically smaller number of lines required at some other languages. My first programming steps were in Java, during the &lt;em&gt;Introduction to programming&lt;/em&gt; course at the Faculty of Mathematics and Physics, Ljubljana. Java and I didn't get along well. I enjoyed the course but writing Java code didn't really inspire me. The second year, however, our tutors upgraded to Python. Now that felt pretty good. I felt much more comfortable writing small scripts in Python than Java and used Python and it's ecosystem in other courses as well.
Python code, however, sometimes behaves in a way that seems buggy at first, unless you know what is happening.&lt;/p&gt;
