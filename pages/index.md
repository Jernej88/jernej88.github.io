# Hi dear visitor

![Me waving at you!](portrait_1_xs.png){: style="float:right; padding:16px"}
I am Jernej Zupančič. I am interested in applying data and data manipulation to solve real world problems.

## My interests

This includes getting the data from A to B, transforming it, enriching it with other sources, slicing and dicing it, in a way that is most helpful to the final user, be it an internal team in your organization or a customer. When the data is ready I can also utilize artificial intelligence to bring added value through data applications, machine learning, data science and computational intelligence. To do that well, I am also interested in software development in general and strive to apply best software engineering practices in any organization I work with.

## My work experience

I began my work experience during the college days by mentoring and tutoring in introductory computer-related courses at Faculty for mathematics and physics, University of Ljubljana. I first dipped toes into more serious programming while at Jožef Stefan Institute, where I worked within the Department of intelligent systems. There I cooperated with colleagues in deploying smart and also not so smart solutions in several domains - tourism, customer support, steel casting, smart cities, smart houses, etc. I've applied machine learning, data visualization, single- and multi-objective optimization methods to solve real and real-like problems.

During that time I came to like technology that enables one to do a lot quickly. This includes Python, Docker, Linux, git, PostgreSQL and even a little bit of Javascript.

I am currently a freelancer, doing various tasks that include data wrangling and coming up with algorithms to elegantly solve real world problems (hint, it is not always deep learning).

Here is [my CV](jernej_zupancic_CV_no_contacts.pdf), if you are into such things. 

Have a good day!
