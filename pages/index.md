Hi, I am Jernej Zupančič. I am a research assistant at [Jozef Stefan Institute](https://ijs.si/ijsw/V001/JSI") and a PhD student at [Jozef Stefan International Postgraduate School](https://www.mps.si/en/) in Ljubljana, Slovenia. I am interested in applying artificial intelligence to real world applications either through machine learning, data science and computational intelligence. I am also interested in software development in general and strive to apply best practices throughout the organization.
