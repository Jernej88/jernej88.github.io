So here it goes, my first post on my first blog. The goal of this blog is to document the things I learn related to technology, software development, artificial intelligence, project management and soft skills. Occasionally I will add a thought or two about life in general.

# Who is this for

The primary reader is probably the future me, since I expect to document solutions to the problems I encounter on a daily basis. First, by writing them down I hope to memorize them better. Second, I have a central location I can search over in case I need to remember something. The secondary reader is you, dear reader. I hope you find answers to some of the question and issues you searched for using your favorite search engine.

# Some technical stuff

I'm using the excellent [Nikola](https://getnikola.com) static site generator for publishing this content. I have chosen it because of the promised good support of [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) notebooks. We'll see how that goes. I have leaned on [Jiawei Zhuang blogpost](https://jiaweizhuang.github.io/blog/nikola-guide/) when setting up the theme and some other settings, although Nikola's documentation is already quite readable.
